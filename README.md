# video-gesture

An application to control your YouTube videos with hand gestures. This project was made for the PRG8 course.

## Scripts

After cloning this project, you can start it using:

- `pnpm dev`: Starts the Vite development server
- (optional): view rules of existing eslint configuration `pnpx @eslint/config-inspector@latest`

## Current Issues

If you want to manually unmute the video with the mouse, you temporarily need to perform a different pose so that you can control the video with the mouse again.
