## General
~ fix bug: Clicking stop classifying, doesn't stop calling classification
	- It turns out that it does fire "stop clasification" but something else turns it on again.
    	- Now I have to figure out what calls it again.
- fix bug: classification influences how many times an event is called

- EXTRA: have notification that says that camera permission needs to be turned on.

## Optional UX improvements:
- notification when webcam is not toggled on
